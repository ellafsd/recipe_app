      "Prepare the dry mixture:\nIn a large mixing bowl",
      "combine 2 cups of flour and 1 teaspoon of salt. Mix thoroughly to evenly distribute the salt throughout the flour.\n\nForm the dough:\nSlowly pour in about 1 cup of water",
      "a little at a time",
      "while stirring the mixture with your hand or a wooden spoon. Continue adding water gradually until a rough dough starts to form.\n\nKnead the dough:\nTransfer the dough onto a clean",
      "lightly floured surface. Knead the dough by pressing and folding it for about 8‚Äì10 minutes",
      "until it becomes smooth and elastic. If the dough feels too sticky",
      "sprinkle a little extra flour as needed.\n\nRest the dough:\nForm the dough into a ball",
      "cover it with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap",
      "and let it rest for about 30 minutes. This helps the gluten relax and makes the dough easier to roll out.\n\nRoll and shape:\nAfter resting",
      "divide the dough into smaller pieces. Roll out each piece with a rolling pin or pasta machine to your desired thickness. Then cut into thin strips to make spaghetti noodles.\n\nCook the pasta:\nBring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the fresh spaghetti and cook for about 2‚Äì4 minutes",
      "or until the pasta floats and is tender but still slightly firm (al dente).\n\nServe:\nDrain the cooked pasta and immediately toss it with your favorite Carbonara sauce or any sauce of your choice. Serve hot and enjoy!"
